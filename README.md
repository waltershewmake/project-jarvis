# Project J.A.R.V.I.S.

## Description

This is my attempt to create a personal assistant like J.A.R.V.I.S. from the movie "Iron Man" and "The Avengers". This project is inspired by the movie but is also a practical project that can be used in real life. The project is still in development and many features are being added. The idea is to create a highly extensible and customizable personal assistant with complex RAG and NLP capabilities.

- [ ] CLI interface
- [ ] Chat (RAG, remember everything, sync across devices)
- [ ] Actions interface (lights, order food, add tasks to calendar, etc)
- [ ] Web search capabilities
- [ ] Reminders (remind yourself of tasks and have JARVIS drop in on you)
- [ ] Voice Commands and recognition (identify yourself and authenticate using your voice)
- [ ] Web UI
